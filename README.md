## Guide

Weather Report is a program that accesses Weather Underground's API
(https://www.wunderground.com/weather/api/d/docs?MR=1). The program prompts the user
for a zip code and, using request methods, displays various information on that
location's weather patterns - temperature, sunrise, sunset, etc.
